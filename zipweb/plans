for the web:
there will be an editing interface: for editing files
normally and for editing files inside zip and dZip files;
files: zip, txts, etc will all be saved 'online';
I might have to do a login interface;
user will have the choice to download the files either as
zips -compression level: 8, dZip - compressed zips of compressed files

Make it possible for files to be added to an archive (zip of dZip)

try putting a copyright or sth in your dZip files 

Js: When file is chosen make the file look nice
like an icon or as if it was added to a list of files to be compressed;
use drag and drop; to add files to archive;
 you won't be able to drag and drop into a 'parent' only different;
the icon will be like a DanFile class with many events: make another js file;
you will be able to select all, unselect etc
the files you'll be able to edit i.e. text files: html, css, js, txt, xml, etc;



class DanFile{
    methods: open- addEventListener(dblclick): window opens having
    minimize, maximize and close buttons with ; close
}

maybe DanZipFile and DandZipFile will inherit from DanFile;
and both should open windows to view their contents which would
be able to be edited by tapping on them: opening new windows too
which would be added to windows -an array


classes to be defined -using separate JS files of course

DanFile; DanZipFile; DandZipFile
Window; Icon;


images to use: txt.png, html.png, js.png, ....png; id3: zip.png, dZip.png, folder.png
ask brother if he can do UIUX for you;

link i.e. <a></a> download property to retrieve the zip files;
only normal files, zips and dZips will be downloadable;
maybe the Icon will have a download button near it: like in xender
it will have both checkbox for selecting and drag select like fileexplorer
: it will need good design

do an onauxclick on the div where files and folders are to show 
a menu in which you can select 'sort by' and 'group by' options.
Maybe there should be an upper tab for controling files like in fileexplorer:
properties button, delete, sort by, group by, view (if possible), etc.
the 'new item' button should have options: renaming to any unsported
types will say error: unsported types will not have a 'open' method;
maybe they will have a 'open as readonly text';
i'll have to check all mime types to see which are text-based



A typical user object:
{
    files: {'a.txt': {/*properties for each 'file' object*/}, b.html, etc}
    ,archives: {
        zips: {a.zip, b.zip}
        , dZips: {c.dZip, g.dZip}
     }
    ,folders: {homethings, facebook, sd.s},
    , username='Daniel', spaceused: 2097152,
    //just for storage in main users.json file (or maybe there should
    be no json file -only folders containing the names)
    username: 'Daniel', email: 'balablue@gmail.com',
    phone: 070..., password: 323223
},
properties for 'file' objects
[size, date-created, date-modified, date-accessed, ]

maybe in the back-end it file objects would either be from a class which
inherits from pathlike or will just be pathlike;

I might learn database: sqlite3/anyone else or just use additional functions
to convert json data to what I want it to be;

there might be a preview for html files: my next project (or I might
do it before doing this one) will be to make a codepen: html, css, js + python
for back-end: it will be easier just folders and files (4 types of files!)


login.html do not need to have a back-end script: just use js to fetch
users.json and check user and password;

wait(()=>!wids[this.name].open
                        , ()=>{
                          this.close();
                          setTimeout(()=>this.show(f, text, former, ok, cancel), 200)
                        });
