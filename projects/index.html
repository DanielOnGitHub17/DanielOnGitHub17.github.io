        <span>Wooden</span>
        Wooden is a simple multiplayer game involving moving a character to break all
        wooden blocks on a site.
        Implemented in Django, it uses django ASGI interface to communicate
        with JavaScript's WebSockets, allowing frequent changes to be speedily updated.

        Prototype Website for my Mother's small business. 
        This website not only advertises women headwear, but aims to support order placing, and
        online apprenticeship. For now, you can just swipe through photos.

        <span>Web Image Extractor</span>
        Image Extractor only needs a URL to download a webpage's image data.
        Suprisingly it works using only Python Standard Library Modules, performing tasks
        like intense html and css parsing, and basic operating system operations.

        <span>Windows File Explorer</span>
        File Explorer can get you to a file or folder quickly. While it is not heavy on aesthetics, it 
        has an edge on speed as it uses little resources to navigate the File system.
        Additionally, Explorer can perform operations like 
        creating, renaming, sorting, starting, archiving, deleting, and showing properties of files and folders.

        <span>Web Interview</span>
        Okay. While I made this to practice for my Visa Interview, it can be utilized in different scenarios.
        Want to quiz yourself on any topic? Do so. Want to do a funny AI question and answer series? Why not?
        The platform saves your questions for later, captures video or text data, and provides useful customizations.

        <span>Phone Patterns</span>
        The unlock pattern of a phone can be represented a string of digits.
        With this knowledge, I built this simulator to mimic all possible phone patterns.
        The website transforms previously generated Python numeric strings stored in JSON files, to
        phone patterns that can be animated and saved.

        You only need to add your internship application details for it to organize them
        in on the browser's screen, and save them in your browser's local storage.
