        <span>Wooden</span>
        Wooden is a simple multiplayer game that involves moving a character to break
        wooden blocks on the game play site, earning points as blocks a cleared faster.
        Implemented in Django, it aims to use asynchronous views to communicate
        with JavaScript's WebSockets, allowing frequent changes to be speedily updated.

        <span>Zip Web</span>
        As the name hints, Zip Web is a web application for compressing and 
        extracting archive files. Using Python as a local backend, it uses 
        standard modules to manage user uploaded files and folders.
        Also it manages to provide a user-friendly user interface, using styled
        widgets and buttons to provide a smooth experience.
        Zip Web was built on Python's own http.server, implementing the deprecated Python CGI module.

        <span>Hats and Fascinators</span>
        Prototype Website for my Mother's small business. 
        This website not only advertises women headwear, but aims to support order placing, and
        online apprenticeship. For now, though, you can just swipe through photos.

        <span>Web Image Extractor</span>
        Image Extractor only needs a URL to download a webpage's image data.
        Suprisingly it works using only Python Standard Library Modules, performing tasks
        like intense html and css parsing, and basic operating system operations.

        <span>Windows File Explorer</span>
        File Explorer can get you to a file or folder quickly. While it is not heavy on aesthetics, it 
        has an edge on speed as it uses little resources to navigate the file system.
        Additionally, Explorer can perform operations like 
        creating, renaming, sorting, starting, archiving, deleting, and showing properties of files and folders.

        <span>Web Interview</span>
        Okay. While I made this to practice for my Visa Interview, it can be utilized in different scenarios.
        Want to quiz yourself on any topic? Do so. Want to do a funny AI question and answer series? Why not?
        This platform saves your questions for later, captures video or text data, and provides useful customizations.

        <span>Phone Patterns</span>
        The unlock pattern of a phone can be represented as a string of digits.
        With this knowledge, I built this simulator to mimic all possible phone patterns.
        The website transforms previously generated Python numeric strings stored in JSON files, to
        phone patterns that can be animated and saved.

        <span>Mathematics</span>
        Yes, I LOVE math, so I wrote JavaScript algorithms to solve simple and intermidiate math problems.
        Ranging from performing Matrix operations to evaluating values of equations in tables,
        these webpages aid in digesting mathematical concepts.

        <span>Internship Tracker</span>
        My internship tracking simple blue interface helps you keep track of job opportunities without stress.
        Have fun clicking the add button, rest assured that your data is persisted
        in your browser's localStorage (until you clear browser memory of course).

        <span>Random Sparkles</span>
        It is a wonder how I created this one.
        Random Sparkles basically creates small lines by switching between drawing and
        moving to random points on a region.
        It also has a pulsing circle in its center, which spawns tiny other pulsing circles. 
        While it incurs tiny performance issues, its reasonably complex algorithm logic really pays off.

        <span>Cat and mice</span>
        I first learnt object oriented programming through C++.
        While I do not use the language currently, I tkinkered with it some time ago,
        using the DevCPP and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).
        Here is the source code for a simple game I made.

    <h3 id="msvsbs">Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span>All</span>
        As Microsoft Visual Basic was one of the first programming languages I learnt,
        I have a couple of projects implemented in it.
        I was able to modify Word and Excel documents, making their entities
        act on events and inputs.
