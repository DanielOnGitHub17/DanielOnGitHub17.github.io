<p>Nigeria is a resource-rich coastal country in West Africa. Located near the equator, it is bordered by Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Benin, and the Atlantic Ocean. Having an area of more than double the size of California, Nigeria serves as a platform for many rivers, a good soil for many forests, a habitat for wild animals, and a treasure trove of solid, liquid, and gaseous valuable minerals. The abundance of good clayey soil in Nigeria, which accounted for the 900 BC Nok people's sculptures, is complemented by large quantities of Tin, Coal, Limestone, Gold, and petroleum. Furthermore, Nigeria has plenty of water, wind, and sunlight, elements that serve as food and electricity sources, energy reserves, and good weather determinants.</p>
<p>To harness its wealth, Nigeria contains some of the most intriguing people. Scattered across seven-hundred and seventy-four Local Government Areas in thirty-six states of the federation, these two hundred million people make the nation what it is. While using their country's resources, they speak English, Pijin, and other languages. Moreover, they practice religion throughout their lifetime; cook and eat some of the best delicacies; and work to live, affirming that the lazy deserve no food. Nigerians are unique treasures. Other countries might also be rich in gold and petroleum, but only Nigeria has abundant Nigerians.</p>
<p>The Nigerian culture is defined by speech. Most Nigerians speak Hausa, Yoruba, or Igbo, the three core languages. The Hausas are concentrated in Northern Nigeria, the Yorubas in the South-West, and the Igbos in the East. These three languages are varied throughout the country, diffused from origin to neighboring states, forming more than five hundred others. Language is the major feature of Nigerian tribes, accounting for the many customs, folklore, proverbs, and superstitions present in the nation. For example, the Gwaris (a Hausa-based tribe), do not carry loads on their heads; saying that the head is king, they use their shoulders instead. Also, the Yorubas are sensitive when it comes to greetings, bowing or lying flat to say good morning to elders. Additionally, in most Nigerian tribes, it is considered disrespectful to accept an item with the left hand, bad luck to run into a spider's web, and rude to whistle at night. These language-specific traditions not only classify Nigerians but also make them different from other people.</p>
<p>Although Nigeria's many languages differentiate its people, Nigerians have a common tongue that unites them. Nigerians of all ages (including those who cannot speak English yet), speak Pijin, a modified form of the English language, resulting from subtracting and adding some vocabulary. The language has an abundance of slangs, humorous phrases, contractions, and repetitions, derived from the three dominant Nigerian languages. For example, "Why una dey do like say na una sabi pass?" means "Why do you people behave like you know everything?" in English. Most Nigerians understand this vernacular, so communication difficulties are reduced among people of different languages. Moreover, this dialect is local to Nigerians, sparingly understandable by some other West Africans. Nigerians can be thought of as &ldquo;People who speak Pijin&rdquo;. Amongst other tribe-specific languages, this language brings the Nigerians together. They crack jokes, sing, curse, and bless in Pijin. Language difference is a problem within some countries, but Nigeria has a solution.</p>
<p>Nigerians are characterized, not only by speech but also by spirituality. Most Nigerians identify as either Christian or Muslim and although not every Nigerian has high moral standards, they do not tend to be atheistic. The immoral show reverence for either Christ or Muhammad, occasionally attending church services or appearing in Muslim gatherings, or becoming suddenly devout when they face challenges; however, the pious reach extremes in their beliefs, frequently fasting, praying, and reading holy books. Nigerian Christians worship for hours into the night, and the Muslims call their prayers over loud speakers during their Salat. Nigerians, before missionary arrivals, were once committed to idol worship, having laws specific to each idol. Therefore, they exert all their energy in worshiping a true God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nigerians can be described by their food taste. Nigerians enhance meals, which are conventionally cooked, chewed and swallowed, by skipping the chewing part. The people in this part of West Africa are fond of processing their food from tuber, grain, or powder into dough-like forms known as &lsquo;swallow&rsquo;. They then consume this dough by repeatedly dipping small cuts of it into some soup and swallowing the cuts without chewing. The kneaded food is swallowed whole, reducing eating time, and satiating the eater faster. Also, the word swallow invokes the memory of Nigerian soups, which are swallowed by the dough. On one hand, some, like Okra soup, are slimy and aid faster swallowing. On the other hand, others, like bitter-leaf, beans, and melon soup, cause friction in swallowing, but could stop hunger if the eater gets weary after eating little. While other chewable food exists in the republic, the &lsquo;swallows&rsquo; are considered best.</p>
<p>Nigerians say, &ldquo;No food for lazy man&rdquo;. They are convinced that hard work in a field produces success, so they work hard. Those who are fit for school study intensively, and those who have jobs put much effort into their occupation. Nigerians commonly refer to their work as &lsquo;Hustle&rsquo;, showing the energy they put into making a living. &ldquo;Hustle must pay&rdquo;, they constantly remind themselves, working diligently to achieve success. Working Nigerians attain respect from juniors, who see them as role models; peers, who are challenged by their determination; and elders, who praise their labor. Nigerians can survive anywhere, given that they have something productive to do.</p>
<p>Nigerians are a black, religious, innovative, and resourceful people. They make their livelihood through hard work, which gets easy as they keep on pressing, conversing with each other to make bargains, eating the best food for fuel, and trusting the power of a deity to bring them success. Nigerians understand what it means to relax, or &lsquo;flex&rsquo; as they would say. They can prepare delicious meals and crack the funniest jokes. But they can also wake up by four in the morning to make buns to sell for the day, or spend hours into the night, preparing for a test. These African giants, through hard work bolstered by their relaxation and faith, keep their country at the top of Africa&rsquo;s economy.</p>
