<p><span>Statutes over Statues: Destroying Racial Injustice</span></p>
<p>Since 2015, more than 140 monuments of the Confederacy have been removed from across the United States (Berkowitz and Blanco). Created years after the Civil War and ranging from statues and portraits to street and school names, these memorials accuse America, giving evidence of a brutal history to both those whose near ancestors had suffered in the old America and those who have only heard tales of the past &ndash; who suffer in other ways today, hoping that America becomes free of the plague of racial discrimination. Considering the 2015 mass murder at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the 2017 disheartening death of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia; the 2020 heartless murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and other cruel racial crimes of the twenty-first century, the need to fight racism is crucial. Therefore, in addition to other actions aimed at creating an America that is not spotted by racial injustice, including the passing of the Civil and Voting Rights Act in 1964 and 1965, respectively; the call for underrepresented individuals in companies; and the election of Barrack Obama, plans to destroy the monuments that uphold slavery should be executed.</p>
<p>Not all support this objective, however. Donald Trump, for example, declares that the destruction of these monuments is &ldquo;&hellip; a disgrace to our country!&rdquo; (Trump) when the actual disgrace is America&rsquo;s situation of talking about abolishing racism without doing everything to curb it. He is not alone in this inaccurate reasoning. Some people argue that removing these monuments will cause societal troubles, triggering riots from those who believe that the statues should remain. Others maintain that these statues honor the intentions of &lsquo;noble&rsquo; generals and &lsquo;brave&rsquo; soldiers who fought valiantly for their states, believing that memorials dedicated to such &lsquo;heroes&rsquo; should not be removed. Additionally, many insist that these statues are evidence of the rich history of the United States, persisting that their removal will tarnish American History. These reasons are not sufficient enough to cease the removal of Confederate memorials. The monuments are somewhat offensive; their preservation implies America&rsquo;s consent to slavery and white supremacy. Therefore, to make sure that America despises its use of forced labor in the past, Confederate figures should not exist.</p>
<p>Firstly, the preservation of Confederate commemoratives, not their removal, is more likely to initiate aggression. The statues offend the black American population, portraying America as a country that honors the torture of their African-American ancestors. The objects also upset the white population since the underrepresented accuse them. Also, protests are already happening, requiring the destruction of these statues. Following the racial killing of George Floyd, for example, people protested across America, leading rightly to the removal of a 130-year-old, 12-ton statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Richmond (Little). Riots such as these could be avoided if the right thing is done. The purging of these markers is an excellent step in erasing racial injustice. Whatever the incentive, doing otherwise will invoke hostility and not safeguard peace.</p>
<p>Another hindrance to the removal of Confederate monuments is the belief that the memorials should be preserved since they celebrate the heroism of their human counterparts. In contrast, there is nothing honorable about fighting for a wrong purpose, especially if that objective involves subjecting fellow humans to hard labor and pain to benefit an economy. It is just as Foster Ockerman, Historian at Lexington History Museum, says on Al Jazeera, &ldquo;&hellip;if black lives matter, why are we honoring men who did not honor black lives&rdquo; (&ldquo;Kentucky&rdquo; 01:07-01:14). People should not be misinformed about the reason behind the Civil War. The Confederacy was wrong, so arguing that the Confederate intent was for the best or that it did no harm indicates support for the cause, which was, thankfully, lost. Therefore, for the United States to make things right, it must denounce wrong bravery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Confederate monuments are destroyed, history is correctly portrayed. The protection of Confederate statues hints at America as a nation that reverences its disturbing past. If foreigners are convinced that white supremacy is presently condemned in America, they would, of course, be startled to see a memorial dedicated to a historical enslaver. Also, as Mitch Landrieu, sixty-first Mayor of New Orleans, says, &ldquo;These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement and terror that it actually stood for.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Whose Heritage&rdquo;). As supported by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, faulty history should be edited accordingly. Moreover, in making the twenty-first century a time when Confederate statues were all removed &ndash; for the benefit of the nation &ndash;people inadvertently write a new history for generations to come, showing their unborn descendants that the Confederacy stood on a faulty foundation.</p>
<p>As America works towards becoming a model equal opportunity nation, eliminating all traces of racism and supremacism along the way, support for annihilating Confederate monuments should increase. Willingly and jointly, Americans should direct their intelligence and enthusiasm toward tearing down any suggestion of racial oppression across the nation. Just as Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, which, according to its mayor, Levar M. Stoney, has moved forward from its past of hosting &ldquo;&hellip;more Confederate statues than any city in the United States&rdquo;, saw to the condemnation of all its Confederate marks, thereby steadily becoming &ldquo;&hellip; a more inclusive and welcoming place where ALL belong&rdquo; (Stoney), all other states should eliminate Confederate monuments. Through this, the United States can finally be healed from the scars of the Civil War and proceed toward a point when racism eventually becomes obsolete.</p>
