<p><span>Wealth in Poverty, the Christmas Irony.</p>
<p>Like in most developing countries, children in Nigeria are grouped into two extreme categories. The rich in cities and the poor in villages. Since children in both categories are Nigerians, they share common child-life experiences. They remain under the control of their parents, shouted at and punished severely sometimes. Also, they are obliged to practice the religion and uphold the beliefs of their parents, forcibly participating in lengthy morning prayers or abstaining from pork. As for their education, they spend eight to ten hours of their weekdays in elementary school, struggling with basic mathematics or learning to pronounce difficult English words. Their social life would seem amusing to a teenager. They make and break up with friends for insignificant reasons; step on the toes of those they hate, liberally expressing their feelings; laugh at the silliest jokes and cry at the slightest provocation. Generally, they are dark or fair-skinned, dark-haired young ambitious humans, begging to do what they want.</p>
<p>Although Nigerian children perform similar activities, they are sharply differentiated by the manner and context in which they do those activities. The poor category faces tougher punishments. Unlike their well-to-do counterparts who are seldom spanked, they are spanked, flogged, grounded, and, worst of all, insulted for any misbehavior by a surly parent. School is also different. While the rich go to school in cars, arriving to sit in a well-furnished classroom, the poor trek, entering to share hard wooden benches with their classmates or manage the floor if they are bereaved of seats. Also, the village children know nothing about the rich children's games. While the rich are provided with desktop computers, game consoles, and mobile phones for video games, the poor play with whatever they can find. They use stones for various types of hopscotch; throw cashew fruits from a distance to knock off those of others; or dig small holes in the ground to play a varied version of Mancala called Ayo. Nigerian children, wealthy or not, get their pains and pleasures; they just derive these in different ways.</p>
<p>The disparity between the two parties becomes greater during celebrations. To the affluent young fellows, Christmas simply means a little more luxury. They prefer traveling out of the country. Wanting to see the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom again, they prepare to fly with their parents. When they decide to stay back in Nigeria, they adorn their houses with Christmas decorations, erect an awe-striking Christmas tree, and host Christmas parties. Additionally, they visit amusement parks, trying out all amusements with the money from their parents. Christmas gives the rich children extra pleasure, and they flow along with it, spending bountifully to have the very best.</p>
<p>The celebration of Christmas in the cities is magnificent: streets are brighter than usual, parks are fuller than usual, and carol songs resound from churches around. Nevertheless, it is evident that however fine the celebrations might be, they remain normal. The rich use only a small portion of their wealth for enjoyment, so their children are used to the added luxury during Christmas. The children take eating in expensive restaurants for granted. They think it is normal to ride on roller coasters or use virtual reality glasses in parks. Just like on other days, they get whatever they want, so ideally there is not much change. They expect the best, so they do not appreciate it.</p>
<p>Things are different in villages. For six-to-ten-year-old Nigerians living in these parts, Christmas means, first of all, food. Perhaps the most animal slaughter happens in Nigerian villages during Christmas. Children attend the funerals of murdered chickens, soaking them in hot water and stripping their corpses of feathers. Moreover, as the raw meat is divided, the children contain their ecstasy while washing it in water, and wander around the kitchen when the meat is cooking, taking in its glorious aroma and waiting to get a first taste of it. The children eat the chicken with delicacies: the best jollof rice, cooked in the chicken soup and made shiny with oil; the most elastic pounded yam, prepared by using a pestle to skillfully mold the finest yams in a mortar; and the delicious melon soup, decorated with shredded vegetable leaves, and prepared to be eaten with the pounded yam. Furthermore, the village children engage in their custom of walking about with spoons in their pockets, visiting the houses of their neighbors&nbsp;to sample the food whose aroma had called them. At Christmas, these children eat to their taste, happy to take a break from the bare meals they have managed in the past months.</p>
<p>Apart from the food, new clothing also makes village children happy during Christmas. Characterized by having few clothes, these children appreciate the value of freshly sown attires. They couple their clothing with fancy dark eyeglasses and Ben-Ten wristwatches, and they walk back from Christmas mass feeling opulent as they admire and envy each other. Aware that they will get only a few new clothes in the next year, they relish this time of newness, making sure to visit their friends and enemies to show off their regalia. The children regard these outfits as Christmas gifts, and even if they receive no more than that, they are pleased and grateful to their parents.</p>
<p>Best of all, to the children in Nigerian villages, Christmas is a time of rest. The schoolchildren are overjoyed at the reality of not walking long distances to school, and delighted at the relief from punishments of tough school teachers. The children who stay at home, helping their parents raise money for the family, appreciate this time of the year when they get rewards for their labor. The poor children do not have to work for food and clothing during Christmas; For this short period, they are free from all the struggles that accompany their class, so they rejoice. Christmas is the time when they can safely ignore their hardship.</p>
<p>The irony of Christmas in Nigeria is striking. When the wealthy celebrate expensively, they act normally; however, the poor are extraordinary during Christmas time. While they spend a large portion of their savings on the celebration, they are rewarded with joy, satisfaction, and reinforced unity as family and friends come together. Also, the toils of poor Nigerian children, along with their patience and hope of relief, bolsters their gladness during Christmas. They eat and drink till they are overfed, a condition that rarely happens. They wear new clothes, not secondhand dresses. They bask in their rest, forgetting the year&rsquo;s struggle. The rich can keep their money, the poor have happiness.</p>
