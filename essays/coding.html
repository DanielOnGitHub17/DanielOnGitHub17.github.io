<p>I have loved computers since I was little, fascinated first by computer games: tiny worlds clearly evolving out of nothing with controllable characters who either repeated my statements or destroyed my alien enemies. I wondered, while listening to my primary school teacher speak on computer generations, how man could reduce Charles Babbage's math-solving analytical engine, which was as big as a room, into a pocket calculator, which was much smaller than a room, and then make the pocket calculator an application in an even smaller cell phone. Although I was little, I was big enough to appreciate innovation, so I decided to learn how to build computer software. Therefore, when I learned in junior secondary school that computer programming was the key to fulfilling my dream, I began my journey into the field of software development, learning programming languages, practicing regularly, and making coding my hobby.</p>
<p>My activity usually begins in a room in which the scratching of my pen on paper is the only sound. In my brain, however, my initially quiet thoughts steadily become so noisy that I wish my hands could write them down faster. I smile, happy that I have ideas.&nbsp; Separated from the outside world, I ignore the possibility of missing my lunch and the certainty of missing out on outdoor activities. Sometimes, I barely return the greetings of family or friends who come to check on me, too absorbed to appreciate their care. At other times, I excitedly describe my doings and the results I expected to them, grinning when I see either boredom, false understanding, or mild interest written on their faces. Turning back to my project book, I make diagrams and algorithms flow out of my pen, rapidly harmonizing my scattered thoughts on paper, anticipating the moment when I would get to implement my design into actual computer programs.</p>
<p>My coding process becomes more engaging when I start typing code. On opening my blue, small-sized Hewlett-Packard laptop and breathing in its bookish smell, excitement starts building up in me. I impatiently wait for the computer to boot, and when it does, my ritual begins. I open either the Python Integrated Development Environment or the Microsoft Edge browser developer tools to set up my project. On resting my hands on the laptop's built-in keyboard&mdash;my index fingers automatically finding the 'F' and 'J' keys, my designs within my reach, waiting to be transformed into Python or JavaScript&mdash;I am translated into the world where my code lives. And as my fingers fly, producing satisfactory clicking sounds from the keyboard at very short intervals, I become even more attached, fixing my eyes on the code building up on my screen; shaking whenever I encounter execution errors, as if I crashed with the vehicle transporting my code; breathing heavily when I code a crucial part, anxious about failures; feeling the dimples on my face deepen and tracing the happiness in my reflected eyes as I watch my code execute successfully.</p>
<p>My diverse programming results&mdash;ranging from an unaided math-solving Microsoft Word document and a website generating all phone unlock patterns to a Website Image Downloader and various web-based games&mdash;continue to encourage me, serving as proof that I do not waste my time and mental effort, certifying that I could think of a random problem and have a good attempt at solving it. And although I am far from where I want to be, I see my world encouraging me, whether on the CodePen website where developers showcase their visually appealing projects, on GitHub where software functionality merges with aesthetic value, or in my computer science class where I learn practically with other students of related interests. Moreover, wanting to contribute to the field of computer science, I continue to sharpen my programming skills routinely by taking online courses, staying updated with popular coding tools, and doing more practice, hoping to become a professional software developer one day</p>
